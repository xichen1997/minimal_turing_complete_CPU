⏺ Here's your development roadmap organized in logical progression:

  Phase 1: Core Language Extensions (High Priority)

  Tasks 1-4 build essential programming constructs:
  1. Add comparison operators - Extends your DSL's expressiveness
  2. Implement RETURN instruction - Enables proper function calls
  3. Add stack operations - Foundation for function calls and local variables
  4. Enhance DSL with functions - High-level programming support

  Phase 2: Enhanced CPU & System Foundation (Medium Priority)

  Tasks 5-8 strengthen the underlying system:
  5. More arithmetic operations - Richer computational capabilities
  6. ASCII character support - Text-based programming
  7. Create bootloader - Proper system initialization
  8. Move kernel to 0x1000 - Standard memory layout

  Phase 3: Operating System Services (Medium Priority)

  Tasks 9-12 add OS-level functionality:
  9. System calls & privilege modes - Kernel/user separation
  10. String operations - Text processing capabilities
  11. Enhanced ASCII shell - Better user interface
  12. Debugging tools - Development environment

  Phase 4: Advanced OS Features (Low Priority)

  Tasks 13-16 implement multi-programming:
  13. Process control blocks - Process management foundation
  14. Context switching - Multi-program execution
  15. Process scheduling - Fair resource allocation
  16. Memory protection - Program isolation

  Phase 5: File System & Advanced Features (Low Priority)

  Tasks 17-20 add sophisticated capabilities:
  17. Basic file system - Persistent storage
  18. Online text editor - Interactive file editing
  19. Inter-process communication - Process coordination
  20. Virtual memory - Advanced memory management
